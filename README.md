Briefly describe your project here, including its purpose and main features.

# State Management
In this project, state management plays a crucial role in controlling and updating the data and user interface. Here's how we managed state within the application:

# 1. Component-Level State (useState Hook)
We used the useState hook for managing state within individual components. This was ideal for handling local component-specific data that doesn't need to be shared with other components.
# 2. Context API
For sharing data between components at different levels of the component tree, we utilized the Context API. This was particularly useful for making global data or settings accessible to multiple components.
# 3. External Data/APIs
In addition to managing internal component state, we also integrated external data sources and APIs when necessary. This included making network requests to fetch data and updating our application's state accordingly.

# Conclusion
Effective state management is critical to building maintainable and responsive React applications. In this project, we employed a combination of React's built-in state management features and external libraries where necessary to ensure a smooth user experience.
